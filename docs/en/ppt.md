# Title & Contributions
- Cross-Modal Attention fusion for CT+MRI
- Multi-objective Genetic Optimization (accuracy/efficiency/uncertainty)
- Reproducible pipeline (MLflow + metadata + CI)

# Clinical Motivation
- Multimodal fusion challenges and reliability needs

# Framework Overview
- Diagram: dual-stream backbones + CMA + decoder

# Cross-Modal Attention
- Intuition and small formula

# Genetic Tuning
- Objectives, gene space, operators

# Uncertainty & Postprocess
- MC Dropout/TTA; morphology cleanup

# Datasets & Protocol
- Splits, seeds, metrics

# Main Results
- Dice WT/TC/ET; latency/FLOPs

# Ablation
- CMA on/off; objectives; postprocess

# Visualization & Clinical Insights
- Uncertainty heatmaps; case studies

# Reproducibility
- CLI, MLflow, metadata.json, CI

# Limitations & Future Work
- Generalization; ethics; deployment
