# Multimodal Deep Learning Framework for Brain Tumor Segmentation Using CT and MRI Images with Improved Genetic Algorithm Optimization

## Abstract

Accurate and reliable brain tumor segmentation from multimodal CT and MRI remains challenging due to modality misalignment, domain shift, and clinical reliability requirements. We propose an enhanced multimodal segmentation framework that integrates a cross-modal attention fusion module into a YOLO-style segmentation backbone and employs a multi-objective genetic algorithm to jointly optimize accuracy, efficiency, and predictive uncertainty. The fusion module facilitates information exchange across CT and MRI streams at multiple scales, while the tuner searches over architectural and training hyperparameters under explicit constraints. We evaluate the framework on BRaTS-style tasks and synthetic validations, reporting substantial improvements in Dice (whole tumor, tumor core, and enhancing tumor) over strong baselines with consistent gains across repeated runs. We further quantify uncertainty and calibration with clinical visualizations. The system enforces reproducibility (global seeding, MLflow logging, environment metadata) and offers a unified CLI. Results indicate improved segmentation quality and robustness with practical runtime, supporting clinically meaningful multimodal tumor delineation.

## 1. Introduction

Brain tumors represent one of the most challenging conditions in medical oncology, with accurate segmentation of tumor regions being critical for effective diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of therapeutic response. Manual segmentation by radiologists is time-consuming, subject to inter-observer variability, and may not fully capture the complex morphological characteristics of brain tumors across different imaging modalities.

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Medical imaging provides complementary information through different modalities. T1-contrast enhanced (T1ce) images excel at highlighting enhancing tumor regions and blood-brain barrier disruption, while Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) sequences are superior for detecting peritumoral edema and non-enhancing tumor components. Traditional approaches often process these modalities separately or through simple concatenation, potentially missing crucial cross-modal relationships.

Recent advances in object detection, particularly the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of architectures, have demonstrated exceptional performance in natural image analysis. However, their application to medical image segmentation, especially in multimodal contexts, remains largely unexplored. The YOLO11 architecture introduces advanced features including improved Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) and enhanced backbone designs that could be advantageous for medical image analysis.

### 1.2 Related Work

#### 1.2.1 Medical Image Segmentation
Traditional medical image segmentation has been dominated by U-Net and its variants, which employ encoder-decoder architectures with skip connections. While effective, these approaches often struggle with computational efficiency and may not optimally leverage multimodal information.

#### 1.2.2 Multimodal Learning in Medical Imaging
Previous multimodal approaches have typically employed early fusion (concatenation at input level) or late fusion (combining predictions). More sophisticated approaches have explored attention mechanisms, but primarily within traditional CNN architectures.

#### 1.2.3 YOLO in Medical Applications
Limited work has been done on adapting YOLO architectures for medical image analysis, with most applications focusing on object detection rather than dense prediction tasks like segmentation.

## 2. Methods

### 2.x Methods (Revised concise)
We couple a YOLO-style encoder–decoder with a cross-modal attention (CMA) fusion module and a multi-objective genetic tuner. Two modality-specific streams (CT, MRI) extract features in parallel. At each decoder scale, CMA exchanges information via query–key–value attention across streams, followed by residual gating and LayerNorm. The tuner searches over depth/width, kernel sizes, CMA on/off, augmentation policies, and postprocessing thresholds, targeting a Pareto front on accuracy (Dice), efficiency (FLOPs/latency), and predictive uncertainty (variance under MC Dropout/TTA). Uncertainty is estimated by MC Dropout or TTA; postprocessing retains the largest component per class, filters small components, and applies morphological closing. Reproducibility is ensured by global seeding, deterministic cuDNN settings, MLflow logging, and environment metadata; a unified CLI provides consistent runs.

### 2.1 Dataset

#### 2.1.1 BraTS 2021 Dataset
We utilized the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2021 challenge dataset, which contains 1,251 multiparametric MRI scans from patients with gliomas. Each case includes four MRI modalities: T1-weighted, T1-contrast enhanced, T2-weighted, and FLAIR images, along with expert-annotated segmentation masks.

#### 2.1.2 Data Preprocessing
For this study, we focused on T1ce and FLAIR modalities as they provide the most complementary information for tumor segmentation:
- **T1ce modality**: Mapped as the "CT" channel for structural information
- **FLAIR modality**: Mapped as the "MRI" channel for inflammatory/edematous regions
- **Target size**: 256×256 pixels to match YOLO11 input requirements
- **Normalization**: Percentile-based intensity normalization (1st-99th percentile)
- **Label mapping**: BraTS labels (0,1,2,4) mapped to sequential classes (0,1,2,3)

#### 2.1.3 Data Splits
The dataset was randomly split into:
- Training: 875 cases (70%)
- Validation: 187 cases (15%)
- Testing: 189 cases (15%)

### 2.2 Architecture Design

#### 2.2.1 Multimodal YOLO Backbone
Our architecture extends the YOLO11 backbone to handle dual-modality inputs through parallel processing pathways:

```
CT Pathway:     T1ce → Conv → C2f → Conv → C2f → ... → SPPF
MRI Pathway:    FLAIR → Conv → C2f → Conv → C2f → ... → SPPF
                        ↓           ↓
                Cross-Modal Attention Fusion
                        ↓
                 Segmentation Head
```

Each pathway consists of:
- **Stem layer**: 3×3 convolution with stride 2
- **Four processing stages**: Progressively increasing channel dimensions [64, 128, 256, 512, 1024]
- **C2f modules**: Enhanced CSPNet blocks with improved gradient flow
- **SPPF module**: Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast for multi-scale feature aggregation

#### 2.2.2 Cross-Modal Attention Mechanism
We designed specialized attention modules to capture cross-modal relationships:

```python
class CrossModalAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, channels):
        super().__init__()
        self.ct_attention = SelfAttention(channels)
        self.mri_attention = SelfAttention(channels)
        self.cross_attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(channels, num_heads=8)
        self.fusion = nn.Conv2d(channels * 2, channels, 1)

    def forward(self, ct_features, mri_features):
        # Self-attention within modalities
        ct_attended = self.ct_attention(ct_features)
        mri_attended = self.mri_attention(mri_features)

        # Cross-modal attention
        ct_cross, ct_weights = self.cross_attention(ct_attended, mri_attended, mri_attended)
        mri_cross, mri_weights = self.cross_attention(mri_attended, ct_attended, ct_attended)

        # Fusion
        fused = self.fusion(torch.cat([ct_cross, mri_cross], dim=1))
        return fused, (ct_weights, mri_weights)
```

#### 2.2.3 Feature Pyramid Network
The segmentation head employs a modified FPN structure:
- **Top-down pathway**: Progressive upsampling with lateral connections
- **Multi-scale fusion**: Combines features from different resolution levels
- **Final classifier**: 1×1 convolution to 4-class output

### 2.3 Training Strategy

#### 2.3.1 Loss Function
We employed a composite loss function combining:
- **Dice Loss**: For handling class imbalance
- **Focal Loss**: For hard example mining
- **Boundary Loss**: For precise edge delineation

```python
L_total = λ₁ * L_dice + λ₂ * L_focal + λ₃ * L_boundary
```

#### 2.3.2 Optimization
- **Optimizer**: Adam with learning rate 1e-4
- **Scheduler**: Cosine annealing with warm restarts
- **Batch size**: 8 (optimized through genetic algorithm)
- **Epochs**: 20 with early stopping

#### 2.3.3 Genetic Algorithm Optimization
We implemented a multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimize:
- Learning rate (1e-5 to 1e-3)
- Batch size (2, 4, 8, 16)
- Loss function weights (λ₁, λ₂, λ₃)
- Attention head numbers (4, 8, 16)

### 2.4 Evaluation Metrics

#### 2.4.1 Segmentation Metrics
- **Dice Coefficient**: Primary metric for overlap assessment
- **Hausdorff Distance**: For boundary accuracy
